tractor
=======

An implementation of the card game Tractor.

To play:

Download the binaries server.jar and tractor.jar under the "Releases" tab.
The server.jar executable has no GUI, but can be run on any server location.
The tractor.jar executable has a GUI and can be used as both a server and
client.

For example, you can run server.jar on a server machine, which will output the
IP address. Then the players can run tractor.jar on their respective machines,
and click "Join Room" to connect to that IP.

Or, one player with a server machine can run tractor.jar and click "Create
Room". The IP will be shown in the top left corner. Then the other players
can run tractor.jar and click "Join Room" to connect to that IP.
